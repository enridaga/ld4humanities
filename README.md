Half-day Tutorial (4-hours) to be held at the [Digital Humanities Conference 2019](https://dh2019.adho.org) in Utrecht, Monday 8th July 2019 from 14.00pm.

The tutorial has the following objectives:

- To present the theoretical and technical foundations of Linked Data and introduce basic methods for data production and publishing to students, researchers, and practitioners.
- To provide a reference collection of reusable approaches and techniques to boost an effective adoption of LD in DH projects.
- To showcase a set of innovative methods for extracting and linking data from texts.

**If you plan to attend the tutorial, help us tuning the content for the day by completing this [this form](https://forms.gle/hodNeJ6PhBWqFEkP7).**

## Contents and target audience
The tutorial will be organised in three sessions: 1) Linked Data in a nutshell; 2) Producing and consuming Linked Data; 3) Hybrid methods for working with texts and LD. The content will be tuned to accommodate a wide range of participants, spanning from the student that is curious to hear more about LD to the humanist hacker that looks for a robust toolkit to apply to her research. One output of the tutorial will be an openly accessible and persistent registry of reusable resources for developing linked humanities applications.

## About the Organisers

[Enrico Daga](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/member/enrico-daga) has a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and has carried out research on Web Semantics and Ontology Engineering since 2006, first at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and then at the Knowledge Media Institute of The Open University in the UK, where he leads the OU Linked Data initiative (data.open.ac.uk). He has played key roles in R&D projects related to the development of intelligent systems for Ontology Engineering (NeOn) and Smart Cities (MK:Smart). Currently, he is exploring the application of knowledge-based methods to support scholarship in the humanities (e.g. the LED project). A former student of Music and Performing Arts (University RomaTRE), Enrico is founder and chair of the WHiSe Workshop on Humanities in the Semantic Web.


[Aldo Gangemi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/aldo.gangemi/en) is full professor at University of Bologna, and associate researcher at Italian National Research Council, Rome. He has co-founded the Semantic Technology Lab (STLab) at ISTC-CNR. His research focuses on Semantic Technologies as an integration of methods from Knowledge Engineering, the Semantic Web, Linked Data, Cognitive Science, and Natural Language Processing. He has worked in many different domains, including Cultural Heritage, where he has designed ontologies and linked data (Luoghi della Cultura, ICCDâ€™s ArCo) for the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage. He has published more than 250 papers in international peer-reviewed journals, conferences and books, and seats as EB member of international journals. He has worked in several EU projects related to LOD such as WonderWeb, Metokis, NeOn, and IKS.
